### Task for applying at Pierce AB

## Summary of design thought

It all started with trying to figure out what **elements** will the component have, and how many repeatable content will appear.

This led to a conclusion we will have:
1. main view,
2. post element,
3. comment element.

Then I asked my self how this could be used in the future. I decided to create a **module** out of the code, as the feautre could be used by other apps.

After initial planning it was time for creation of said **module** and **components**, **service** and **routing**. After creating rough initial working solution I went on with **refactoring** until getting the final solution.
